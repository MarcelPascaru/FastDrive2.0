                                Freddy’s Fine Car Rentals is a new, independently-owned car rental service in Omaha,
                                Nebraska. It will be solely-owned by local entrepreneur Freddy Montgomery. Freddy will
                                provide car rentals to residents of Omaha and visitors to the city who need a vehicle
                                for a few days. Freddy’s initial fleet of vehicles will include two sedans, 1 truck, 2
                                large SUVs, and 2 luxury vehicles. Through his market research, Freddy found that
                                visitors to the city need a sedan to get them around for a few days so that they don’t
                                have to rely on public transportation. There are also residents who sometimes need to
                                rent a truck for a day or two while they move something large. There is also a demand
                                for people to want to rent a luxury vehicle for a few days so they can use it for a
                                special occasion without having to put a large investment to purchase one of their own.

                                car for whatever the situation is. There will be a truck for those needing to move large
